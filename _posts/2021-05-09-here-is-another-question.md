Quantum computers are the epitome of science in the present day. They are the fastest computers, making use of atoms mysterious properties. Since microchips are getting tiny, much smaller than a red blood cell. But with the way physics is defined, it simply cannot get any smaller. This then leads to more innovative ways in making powerful computers. 
This blog is short but here is the link to the video I watched about [quantum computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28). Quantum computing is a very interesting subject which combines physics and computing together.

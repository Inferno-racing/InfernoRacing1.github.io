The all new box in Duel Links is here, Antimony's Theory. It is a really cool box as it has many accel synchro monsters
and it is quite fun to play with - of course doing it in loaner deck duels. The new character too is one of Yusei's
friend in the yugioh 5ds anime and he is quite cool. Well, after using all <em> 500 gems</em> on the Judgment force box
which contains World Legacy cards, I had a turbo duel against Antinomy due to the event, and was really fun. I used my
Draguinity deck with Yusei's skill, mark of the Dragon's head, which allowed me to summon Shooting star dragon and
stardust, having them both on the field at the exact same time thanks to Stardust Flash, a card that revives Stardust
dragon from the grave. My favourite deck currently is Shiranui - which I have - and may soon change. I really like World
legacy and the fact that it can make the opponent's extra deck useless is really critical especially if it is a deck
which heavily relies on it.

title: "For the Constellar deck"

I have many deck building aspirations, such as building a deck based on the T.G, a world legacy deck, a star seraph deck and so much more. The main thing though - changing from last week - is the constellar deck. There hasn't been many changes so I figure I should talk about this. The constellar deck is focusing on XYZ summoning; much like gagaga decks and star seraph decks, except there is something about it which makes this deck special, the stars and the fact that I don't recall anyone using it in the anime. Yes... that is the main reasons as to why I am building this deck. 

Also, I realise just now for the world legacy guardragon mardrack, there are two copies in the new blue eyes structure deck, which is helpful. The deck list can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKwzUlfqIQ8&list=WL&index=3&t=569s).

This is 17th May and I have just found that one of the arc v characters in the anime used the constellar archetype and is part of a trio of:
x-saber
gem-knight
constellar

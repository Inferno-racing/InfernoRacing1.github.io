I know. I know. I know. I haven't been posting about anything for some time and I will do this, every Sunday from this week. Now, about yugioh duel links, there was a tournament, an event. It was the KC cup, in response to the cancellation of the international Yugioh tournament. I only got to duel level 10 but it was still fun to play in.

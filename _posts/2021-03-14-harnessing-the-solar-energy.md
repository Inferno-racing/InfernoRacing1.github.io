title: "Can you truly harness the sun's energy?"

I recently watched a series of videos which discuss the power of black holes and most importantly the sun. One question still remained after watching the videos; can you really harness the sun? The video mentioned a lot about the future and the video is right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3y8AIEX_dU). This video talks about how to move the solar system but it does closely relate to and mentions about harnessing the sun's energy. It mentions to use a [dyson sphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP44EPBMb8A), a mega structure which wraps around the entire sun and harnesses its energy. It uses a lot of materials so it is almost impossible to do it now without either destroying the planter or doing something which puts the planet in a more precarious situation than it already is. But this is all hypothetical, so we assume the costs are covered in the future. The benefits of buiding the dyson sphere are huge and means that we won't be using that much more of earth's natural resources such as the fossil fuels. 

The main answer though is no. We cannot build it unless we use up Mercury's resources *Mercury is the riches of the planets in terms of metal*. This is why it is impossible.

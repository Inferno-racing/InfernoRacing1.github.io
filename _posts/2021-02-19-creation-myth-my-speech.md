My speech on Ai is crucial as on Monday I will be saying it in front of people. I wanted to share this speech with you.

### AI speech


Artificial Intelligence (also known as AI) is a tool in our every day lives. AI can be found everywhere, the most commonly known usage is in smartphones and computers. Although there are undoubtedly benefits for them being here, new questions arise from these relatively new machines - there is one main question which scientists still debate on - Is AI taking over the world?
To answer this question, we need to think of the past, where people were just beginning to grasp the concept of AI. Ai was discovered by a group of scientists wanting to copy the human brain. From there, the funding was exponentially growing, thanks to the US Department of Defence. It was at this moment, after a couple of years went by, in 1974, that the money dried up. AI had taken a turn for the worse. The unknown phase of time called the AI winter began.
It was at 1980, where the industry’s hope rekindled thanks to new innovations. The first computer in this period was made, the Lisp Machine. It made a multitude of money, until the failure of it. The money disappeared, now because of the early microcomputers. AI winter returned. Then, the microcomputers were starting to get credited and the money appeared again. AI since then has not experienced a winter
The first computer, the ancient Lisp Machine, was made using a programming language called … Lisp! (No prizes for guessing). Anyway, lots of space was required to house this machine and many household members had use this one machine. The reason being is that it was too expensive. Although many negatives derive from the first computer, the benefits are there. Many inventions such as the printer derived from the Lisp Machine. Then its arch-nemeses arrived - the microcomputer, used in almost all modern day devices. (Locked in eternal battle, they each tried to overcome the other, in the end, the Lisp Machine lost) The truth is, microcomputers are smaller, faster and are able to update easier.
AI winter struck - the Lisp Machine was hoarding a lot of the business’ money, was forever gone. Speaking of which, what is AI winter?
AI winter, and its counterpart AI summer, are both factors deciding the path of AI. AI winter is like trees in Winter, the money being the leaves, disappearing. AI summer can be related to the trees in, well the Summer, the leaves being bountiful like money and growing. There has been two major AI winters, the first being in 1974 - 1980, and the next being in 1987 - 1993. Both had detrimental effects on the industry. There are warnings from scientists of another AI winter arriving so maybe the Summer which we are in will turn into winter?
There are many theories for the future of AI, some saying that there is nothing to worry about and some say they are the biggest threat to humankind. Respected futurist, Ray Kurzweil predicted that humans are going to evolve into cyborgs. Although this may seem farfetched, in some aspects he is right. AI is soaring and already triumphing over humans in many games so you never know. It might happen!
There are also predictions of AI winters by following trends currently. Many of the theories are plausible but my belief is that AI and humans can work together to make and save the world.

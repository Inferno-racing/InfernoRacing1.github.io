This week, I completed three story modes for three games and they were really good. The first game being Ori and the Will of the wisps, which is supposedly (and strongly believe) it is. The graphics were just incredible and the skillset ori has is really fun to use. Sadly, there isn't any special reward for when you defeat the game, just the satisfaction you did. The next was Kingdom hearts 3. Although this did take quite a while, I still managed to complete it, with the ending being extremely sad. I mean imagine the main character, the guy who is friends with everyone, dies just save his <strong>Girlfriend</strong>. The last one was Super Lucky tales. Why I played it you ask? Well, it was curiousity. Happy... It was an interesting game, the 3D layout being cool and it was almost like it is meant for kids. Heh........................
